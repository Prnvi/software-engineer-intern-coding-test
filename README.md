# Software Engineer Intern (JavaScript)

Welcome to DataCamp's Internship Home Assignment!
This assignment is crafted to evaluate your proficiency in various areas, including basic API development, effective interaction with APIs, and solving problems algorithmically.

Inside, you will find two distinct folders, each containing a unique coding challenge:
1. **Coding-Test-Coordinates-API**: Enhance this existing API by adding new functionality;
2. **Coding-Test-Shortest-Path**: Develop an application to calculate and display the shortest route between two points provided by the API.

We estimate that completing these tasks should not exceed two hours. Should you have any inquiries or need clarification, please feel free to reach out to us.

Best of luck!
